# Google Android SQM Project

This repository reflects a systematic Software Quality Management model used in Google Android Operating System  
that is a mobile operating system with massive scale and fragmentation challenges. The project aims at the control of major quality features  
according to ISO/IEC 25010 such as functional suitability, performance efficiency, reliability, usability, security, and maintainability.  
With such a large ecosystem (3.5B+ devices) and diverse hardware, it is important to ensure reliable updates, constant security patching,  
stable performance across devices, and secure user data.

All defects, risks, and improvement activities are captured with the help of GitHub Issues and undergo a project  
workflow in terms of project board (To Do → In Progress → Review → Done). This is a tool that replicates a formal  
quality governance process, in that it provides traceability between quality attributes, defects and risk-mitigating 
activities.
